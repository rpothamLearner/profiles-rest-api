Initialize git project
git init

.git - contains  snapshots as we work on our project

git-ignore file - tells git to not add these files/folders to our project

// how to write markdown files (for README.md)

create gitignore file (copy from a standard gitignore file for python and vagrant)

create a license file (since we are pushing to public git)
